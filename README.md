**HTTP Server in Rust**
=======================

A High-Performance, Minimalist HTTP Server Built with Rust
--------------------------------------------------------

**Overview**
------------

This project showcases a simple yet efficient HTTP server written in Rust, demonstrating the language's capabilities in building high-performance network applications. The server handles incoming TCP connections, parses HTTP requests, and responds with the corresponding HTML content.

**Key Features**
----------------

*   **High-Performance**: Leveraging Rust's ownership model and borrow checker, this server achieves exceptional performance and reliability.
*   **Minimalist Design**: With a focus on simplicity and readability, the codebase is easy to understand and maintain.
*   **HTTP Compliance**: The server adheres to the HTTP/1.1 protocol, supporting GET requests and returning proper status codes.

**Technical Details**
--------------------

*   **Rust Version**: 1.54.0 or later
*   **Dependencies**: `tokio` for asynchronous I/O, `bufstream` for buffered reading, and `fs` for file system interactions
*   **Code Structure**: The project consists of a single module, `handle_connection`, which contains the core server logic

**Example Use Case**
--------------------

To run the server, navigate to the project directory and execute the following command:

```bash
cargo run
```

Open a web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8080` to see the server in action. You can also use tools like `curl` to test the server's response to different requests:

```bash
curl -v http://localhost:8080
```

**Future Development**
----------------------

This project serves as a foundation for more complex web applications. Potential areas for expansion include:

*   **Support for Additional HTTP Methods**: Implementing POST, PUT, DELETE, and other HTTP methods to enable more sophisticated interactions
*   **Dynamic Content Generation**: Integrating a templating engine or database to generate dynamic content
*   **Security Enhancements**: Adding SSL/TLS encryption and authentication mechanisms to ensure secure data transfer
